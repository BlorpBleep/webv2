## Installation Requirements
The CicadaVPN app works on **iOS 14.2** and newer iOS versions. If you encounter any issues with the CicadaVPN connection, please check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Download and Install
1. On your iOS device, open the **App Store**.
2. Search for **CicadaVPN**.
3. Tap **GET** to download the app.
4. Once the app has finished downloading and installing, tap **OPEN** to launch it.

**Can’t find CicadaVPN in the App Store?**  
Try the link to the App Store on our [Download page](#). Note that some country restrictions prevent the app from being available in all countries.

## Vulnerabilities
The following potential privacy issues exist in Apple's iOS and iPadOS:

- **Traffic to Apple services can bypass the VPN tunnel.** This includes iCloud, Maps, Siri, and notifications.
  - **Solution:** None. Apple does not make it possible to send this traffic through a VPN.
- **Connections established before you connect to CicadaVPN can bypass the VPN tunnel.**
  - **Solution:** Connect to CicadaVPN, enable Airplane mode, turn off Wi-Fi if it’s on, then disable Airplane Mode.
- **Apps on the device can bypass the VPN tunnel by routing traffic over cellular/mobile data.**
  - **Solution:** Disable cellular/mobile data when using Wi-Fi.
- **A malicious Wi-Fi network can instruct the device to send Internet traffic outside of the VPN tunnel (TunnelCrack LocalNet attack).**
  - **Solution:** None.

## Quick-Start User’s Guide

### Log In
1. Enter your CicadaVPN account number, then tap the green button with an arrow or the blue Return key on the keyboard.  
   **Note:** See the [FAQ](#faq) if you encounter an error.
2. If you’ve logged in before, the last account number you used will be displayed. To remove it, click the delete icon on the right side of the number.
3. If you log in with the wrong account number, tap the settings icon (gear) in the top right corner and go to **Account > Log out**.

### Using WireGuard
- Each device is associated with a WireGuard key. This is important if you use WireGuard outside of the CicadaVPN app.  
- To find the key:
  - On a router, use the `wg` command with SSH to show the key.
  - In the WireGuard app, find the key in the app (Windows/macOS) or use the `wg` command (Linux).
- The device name and its WireGuard key can be viewed by logging in with your account number on the CicadaVPN website.

**Note:** The CicadaVPN app no longer shows the WireGuard key in the app; you can see the device name in the Account settings instead.

### Redeeming a Voucher Code
Please refer to this [guide](#) for instructions on redeeming a voucher code.

### Add Time to Your Account
You must purchase time for your account to connect to CicadaVPN. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Log in on our website** using your account number and purchase time for your account. Various payment methods are available.
2. **Make an in-app purchase:**
   - Tap the gear icon in the top right corner of the app and go to **Account**.
   - Tap the green **Add 30 days time** button and then tap **Subscribe**.
   - **Note:** In-app purchases are non-recurring one-time payments.
   
   Ensure you write down your CicadaVPN account number for safekeeping.

### Connect
1. You will see the connection status on the app's connection screen. If disconnected, the top bar of the app will be red, displaying "Unsecure connection".
2. To connect to CicadaVPN for the first time:
   - Tap **Select location**.
   - The app will ask for permission to add VPN configurations to your device. Tap **Allow**.
   - Enter your passcode or use your Touch/Face ID to add the VPN configurations.
   - Once connected, the top bar of the app will turn green, displaying "Secure connection", and a VPN icon will appear at the top when you open Control Center.

**Note:** By default, the app connects to a server in Sweden. If you choose a different location, the app will remember your latest selection the next time you start the app.

3. You can also verify your connection with our [Connection check](#).

### Switch Location
- **On iPad:** Select your location in the right sidebar.
- **On iPhone:** Tap the **Select location** button, scroll and tap the country you prefer, and the app will reconnect automatically.

Tapping the drop-down icon (∨) to the right of a location will reveal cities and specific servers to connect to.

## CicadaVPN App Settings

### Account
- Access the account page by clicking the account icon in the top right corner.
- View your account number, device name, and when your paid time runs out. Tap the account number to copy it to your clipboard.
- Add time to your account via an in-app purchase by tapping **Add 30 days time**.
- **Note:** If you tap **Restore purchases**, nothing will happen as Apple does not have your CicadaVPN account number.
- **Log out** if you have logged in with the wrong account number. Ensure you write down the current account number first if it has time on it.
- Use **Delete account** to delete an account. This action is irreversible, and a deleted account cannot be recovered.

### Settings
Access the Settings menu by tapping the gear icon in the top right corner of the connection screen.

#### VPN Settings
- Here, you can adjust options that affect which DNS the app uses.
- Enabling any options will use our filtered DNS server to prevent certain content from loading in your web browser and other apps. If you encounter issues loading a website, try disabling these options. Our filter lists are published on [GitHub](#).

#### Use Custom DNS
This setting allows you to use an external DNS server instead of ours. Follow these instructions:

1. Turn off all the "Block" options.
2. Tap on **Edit** in the top right corner.
3. Tap on **Add a server**.
4. Enter the IP address of an external DNS server.
5. Tap **Done** in the top right corner.
6. Enable the **Use custom DNS** option.

### Report a Problem
If you experience issues, you can send a problem report with the app's anonymized log. Enter your email address if you want a reply. Describe your problem in English or Swedish. You can also tap **View app logs** to see the log yourself.

## Uninstall the App
1. On the home screen, tap and hold the CicadaVPN icon until a menu pops up.
2. Tap **Remove App**.
3. Tap **Delete App** to remove the app from your device. This will also remove the local log files, cache, and settings.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I enable or disable local network sharing?**  
The CicadaVPN iOS/iPadOS app allows local network connections by default, and you cannot disable it. Note that it does not work to use a local DNS, and it may not locate other devices using mDNS broadcasts.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The CicadaVPN app cannot connect to any server. It is unable to establish a secure connection, and the circle just spins. I am not in Russia.**  
Try the following solutions:
1. Tap **Cancel** or **Disconnect** and wait five seconds, then tap **Secure connection**.
2. Tap the account button in the top right corner of the CicadaVPN app (next to the settings icon). Write down your account number, then tap **Log out** and log in again.
3. Go to **CicadaVPN app settings > VPN settings > WireGuard Obfuscation** and set it to "On (UDP-over-TCP)".
4. Delete the CicadaVPN app and install it again from the App Store.
5. Restart the iPhone/iPad.

**Q: The VPN seems to disconnect when I unlock the phone.**  
This can happen when the phone goes to sleep or transitions between using Wi-Fi and mobile data. When you start using it again, it should reconnect automatically. It does not leak any traffic when this happens.  
**Note:** If you are using another app that functions like a VPN (e.g., Lockdown or Blokada), CicadaVPN will disconnect if you activate the other app.

**Q: I purchased more time for my CicadaVPN account, but the app still says the account is "Out of time".**  
You can update the time by logging out of the app (remember to write down your account number first) and then logging in again.

**Q: The CicadaVPN app drains the battery.**  
The battery usage percentage is relative to how much you are using other apps on the device. If you don't use any other apps, CicadaVPN will have a high percentage.  
This can also happen if you have a bad Internet connection signal, as CicadaVPN will use more battery to transfer data. Additionally, after an iOS update, background optimizations may temporarily increase battery usage.

## Feature Requests

**Q: Does the app have a kill switch?**  
The CicadaVPN app uses the "on-demand VPN" function in iOS, which acts as a kill switch when the VPN is connected. It should not leak traffic (with some exceptions) as our VPN always appears as being "up". It is not using "includeAllNetworks".

**Q: I want the app to connect or disconnect CicadaVPN automatically on some Wi-Fi networks.**  
This feature is not planned to be added as it can be a security and privacy risk; someone could set up a network with the same name, causing your device to connect or disconnect automatically.

**Q: Will you add split tunneling to the app?**  
It is not possible to do this on iOS/iPadOS.
