4. After the installation is complete, a message will appear: "Background Items Added - 'CicadaVPN' added items that can run in the background. You can manage this in Login Items Settings."

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Error: "The installation failed"
This error may occur if the installer does not have access to the folder where you downloaded CicadaVPN. It can also happen if you are using Dropbox or Avast Security. To resolve this:

1. Open the **System Settings** app and click on **Privacy & Security** on the left side.
2. Click on **Full Disk Access**.
3. Find **Installer** in the list and click the button to enable full disk access. 
   - If **Installer** is not listed, click the **+** icon at the bottom left. 
   - Select **Applications** in the left column, then choose **Macintosh HD** in the location drop-down menu. Navigate to **System > Library > CoreServices > Installer**.
4. Restart the CicadaVPN installer. It should work now.
5. Once the installation is complete, return to the **System Settings** app and disable full disk access for the Installer.

## Start the CicadaVPN App
1. Launch the CicadaVPN app from **Launchpad** or the **Applications** folder.
2. The first time you start the app, a window may pop up. Click **Open** to continue.
3. Once the app starts, you will see a red padlock icon in the menu bar. Click on the padlock to display the app's login screen. Enter your CicadaVPN account number and click **Secure my connection**.

## Troubleshooting CicadaVPN

### The CicadaVPN Padlock Icon Disappears
- If you're using a MacBook with a camera notch, menu bar icons might be hidden if there are too many. You can fix this by quitting other apps with menu bar icons or disabling some system icons. Keep in mind that menu bar icons can only occupy the space from the right corner to the notch.

### Unable to Use the Internet After Disconnecting CicadaVPN
- Ensure that **Lockdown mode** is not enabled in CicadaVPN's settings.
- Try toggling your Wi-Fi off and on or unplugging and plugging back in your network cable.
- For macOS Ventura:
  1. Open the **System Settings** app, click on **Network**, then select the connected network.
  2. Click on **Details...**, then **DNS**.
  3. Click the **+** button and add a new DNS server, such as `1.1.1.1`. Click **OK**.

## Disable Location Services in macOS
To prevent apps from accessing your location using Wi-Fi or GPS:
1. Open the **System Settings** app.
2. Click on **Privacy & Security** in the left column.
3. Click on **Location Services**.
4. Toggle **Location Services** off.

## Uninstalling the CicadaVPN App

### Uninstall Option 1
This method removes the app, including local log files, cache, and settings:
1. Note down your CicadaVPN account number.
2. Open the **Terminal** app and run the following command:
    ```bash
    /Applications/Cicada\ VPN.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.sh
    ```
3. If prompted, enter your login password (note that the password will not be visible as you type).
4. Restart your Mac.

### Uninstall Option 2
This method only uninstalls the app; local log files, cache, and settings remain on your device:
1. Open the **Applications** folder.
2. Find the CicadaVPN app and drag it to the trash.
3. Choose **Finder > Empty Trash**.
