# How to Order and Manage CicadaVPN Subscriptions

## Ordering CicadaVPN

1. **Choose Your Plan:**
   - You can order CicadaVPN directly from the CicadaVPN homepage, a newsletter, an affiliate, or through various special promotions. The order process takes place online, where you first decide on the payment interval (e.g., monthly or yearly).
   - Scroll down the page to the lower part of the website.

2. **CicadaVPN Account Requirement:**
   - To use a CicadaVPN subscription, you need a CicadaVPN account. Depending on whether or not you already have one, the next steps are slightly different:
   - **Existing Customer:** 
     - If you want to renew, upgrade, or extend your CicadaVPN subscription, please log in to your [Online Account Management](../account) page first. Once logged in, you'll see your account data and the remaining run-time of your current CicadaVPN subscription (if applicable). After purchase, the new subscription will be added as additional time on top of any remaining days. For account recovery, please click [here](account-recovery).
   - **New Customer:**
     - If you are new to CicadaVPN or want a new account, please enter a valid email address, needed for payment confirmation, invoice, and account data delivery. After the purchase is complete, new users will have to set up their password.

3. **Payment:**
   - Choose a payment method, enter your email address, and click on 'Complete your purchase' to enter your payment details. Payments will be processed by a third-party service to avoid privacy breaches based on common databases. Click on 'Next'.
   - All personal data such as credit card numbers, PayPal accounts, names, etc., will stay private with the payment provider and never be submitted to third parties, not even to CicadaVPN.

4. **Subscription Confirmation:**
   - On the next page, check your details and acknowledge that you are purchasing a subscription with recurring payment cycles. Click on 'Next'.
   - Some special conditions (e.g., half the price) are only valid for the first payment, while the next payments will reflect the regular subscription price.
   - After the payment process ends successfully, you will receive a confirmation email with your invoice (where you will find the reference number as well). Please always submit this number if you have questions regarding your purchase, such as asking for a refund or account recovery. You will also be asked to set up a password for your new CicadaVPN web account.

## CicadaVPN’s Refund Policy

CicadaVPN’s refund policy is as follows:

1. **Money-Back Guarantee:**
   - For 1-month subscriptions, we offer a 14-day money-back guarantee.
   - For subscriptions of 6 months or longer, we offer a 45-day money-back guarantee.
   - This means that within 14 or 45 days of your purchase, you can request a refund, no questions asked. 

2. **How to Request a Refund:**
   - You can request a refund by contacting our Support Team through one of the following methods:
     1. **Via email:** [support@cicadavpn.com](mailto:support@cicadavpn.com)
     2. **Via ticket:** [CicadaVPN Support](https://support.cicadavpn.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
     3. **Via our 24/7 Live Chat:** Click on the button in the lower right corner of our website.
   - You should have your purchase Order Number or Reference Number at hand so that our Support Team can find your account quicker. Check your invoice to find all the details.

3. **Note:** 
   - If you purchased a CicadaVPN subscription via the App Store or iTunes, your account is subject to Apple’s terms of service. You will need to request a refund through the App Store.
   - Similarly, if you purchased a CicadaVPN subscription through a physical gift card or a third-party seller, you will need to contact the seller for their respective refund policy.
   - Disabling automatic renewal will not initiate a refund request.

## CicadaVPN Subscription Plans

1. **Subscription Renewal:**
   - You can purchase CicadaVPN as a subscription. If the chosen time frame ends, the subscription will be renewed automatically, and you will be charged again. To end a subscription, you have to cancel it.

2. **Billing Period:**
   - The billing period commences from the time the serial number is input, either by you or automatically on the date of purchase. You have unlimited access to all VPN servers included in your package. If your subscription runs out or is terminated by you, CicadaVPN will not continue to run.

3. **Pricing Information:**
   - For pricing information, please visit our website. Consider subscribing to our newsletter or visiting our homepage, where you might find special conditions or promotional rates.

## Promotions and Retail Versions

1. **Promotions:**
   - Promotional subscriptions are specially priced (or free) CicadaVPN subscriptions with different conditions than usual, mostly regarding the available server pool and in some cases, other traffic limitations. Also, there is a time frame within which a promotional serial must have been activated.

2. **Retail:**
   - Similar conditions might accompany special retail versions of CicadaVPN that can be bought from vendors like Amazon or others. Usually, you will find more features to use than in promotional subscriptions.
