# CicadaVPN Privacy FAQ

## 1. Does CicadaVPN keep logs of my activity?
No, CicadaVPN is a **no-logs VPN**. We do not store or track any of your online activity while you are connected to our servers. This means we do not log your browsing history, connection timestamps, IP addresses, or bandwidth usage.

## 2. What personal information does CicadaVPN collect?
CicadaVPN collects minimal information necessary to manage your account and provide our services. This includes:
- **Email Address**: Used to create and manage your account.

We do not collect any data related to your online activity, browsing habits, or connection logs.

## 3. How does CicadaVPN protect my data?

## 5. What happens if the government requests my data?
CicadaVPN has been designed with privacy in mind. Since we do not keep any logs of your online activity, there is no identifiable data to provide, even if requested by government agencies.
