**Last updated:** February 25, 2024

We use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies (collectively referred to as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy) to help provide, protect, and improve our services and Websites. This Cookie Policy applies to www.cicadavpn.com.

This Cookie Policy supplements our Privacy Policy and explains what cookies are, how and why we use them, the types of cookies we use, and how you can manage your cookie preferences.

The capitalized words used in this Cookie Policy are defined here or in our [Privacy Policy](privacy), and/or our [General Terms](general_terms).

## What are cookies?

In this Cookie Policy, we use the term “cookies” to collectively refer to cookies, pixels, beacons, and related technologies. These small text files are discreetly placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or any other) when you visit Websites. Their functionality is diverse, for example, serving to enhance Websites performance, measure marketing effectiveness, provide unique identification to your web browser, and store settings within it. Also, cookies ensure the delivery of essential communications.

You can learn more about the types of cookies and their functions on various independent information websites, for example, [knowcookies.com](https://knowcookies.com/) or [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/).

## What types of cookies do we use and why?

Cookies can be classified in different ways. For example, according to the company that manages them (cookie origin), the time they remain active (cookie duration), or their purpose.

Understanding these categories is important for managing your preferences regarding the use of cookies and enhancing your user experience. Please find descriptions of cookie categories used on our Websites below.

### By cookie origin:

- **First-party cookies:** These are cookies set directly by us (i.e., our Websites) on users' devices.

- **Third-party cookies:** These cookies are set on users' devices by third-party services integrated into our Websites, such as analytics or advertising platforms. For example, if you access our Websites through a partner's link or interact with embedded content on our Websites, specific cookies help gather data about these interactions. This data can be necessary for enhancing your user experience or providing partner-specific offers.

### By cookie duration:

- **Session cookies:** Temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session; they are erased when users close their browsers.

- **Persistent cookies:** These cookies remain on users' devices for a set duration (from some days to several years), unless they are manually deleted by the user. You can find a detailed description of how to delete cookies in the Cookie Policy section “How can you manage your cookie preferences?”

### By cookie purpose:

- **Essential (strictly necessary) cookies**
- **Functionality cookies**

We enable users of our Websites to express their preferences for the use of certain cookies based on cookie purposes. Find the detailed description of cookie purposes below.

### Essential (strictly necessary) cookies

These cookies are indispensable for maintaining the fundamental functionality of our Websites, so they are set to users’ devices without users’ explicit consent. Essential cookies are necessary to provide our Services and ensure Websites’ features (including the ability to remember your cookie consent preferences) and security. They help us:

For example, we use essential cookies to maintain a record of your cookie preferences and to safeguard the security of our Websites and your sessions (cookies such as _cfruid, rc::c, cf_bm). Some of these cookies are created by our service providers (e.g., Cloudflare).

### Functionality cookies

These cookies are used to enhance user experience by remembering information you have entered or choices you made on the Websites, so the next time you visit, you won't have to set them again. They also enable Websites’ functionalities.

These cookies provide us with aggregated statistical information such as the number of page visits, page load speeds, and how long a user spends on a particular page. Analytics cookies help us to gain a better understanding of how you navigate through and interact with the Websites and Services, and to improve their operational features.

This category includes third-party cookies when considering consent to analytics cookies. You can find the list of our third-party service providers in the Cookie Policy section “Third-Party Service Providers.”
