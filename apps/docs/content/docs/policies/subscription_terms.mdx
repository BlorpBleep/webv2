# Subscription Terms

**Last updated:** May 27, 2024

These Subscription Terms provide key aspects related to your Subscription and are incorporated by reference into the General Terms. Capitalized terms not defined here have the same meaning as defined in the [General Terms](general_terms).

## Please note

The price of our Services in the introductory offers displayed to you is valid only for the first period of your Subscription.

After the first period, your Subscription will be renewed automatically, and you will be charged the then-current price valid at the time of your renewal.

You have the right to cancel the Subscription for the upcoming period. We will notify you about the upcoming automatic renewal in advance.

## 1. Subscription Period and Prices

All our paid services are provided on a Subscription basis. You choose one of the offered periods of Services yourself when you purchase the Services. It will be stated in your purchase confirmation (e.g., the purchase or confirmation email that you will receive from us upon purchase of your Subscription to our Services).

Please note that after your chosen first Subscription period, the provision of Services will be automatically renewed for an additional period (as described below).

The renewal prices displayed on our Websites at the time of your first purchase are subject to change. If the renewal price has changed, you will be charged the then-current (changed) price valid at the time of the automatic renewal of your Subscription.

By submitting your payment details to make a purchase of the Subscription, you (i) express your consent for the automatic renewal of the Services; (ii) confirm your acceptance of the offer to purchase our Services; (iii) acknowledge and agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.

## 2. Automatic Renewal

**Auto-renewal:** After the end of your first Subscription period, your Subscription will be automatically renewed for an additional term:

- **1-year and longer Subscriptions:** for the 1-year Subscription period annually.
- **Shorter than 1-year Subscriptions:** for the same respective Subscription period each time.

You will be charged the then-current price of the Services valid at the time of your renewal.

**Zero Authorization:** By using our Services on a Subscription basis, you authorize CicadaVPN Limited to initiate an authorization transaction equal to zero (or a nominal amount not exceeding 1 USD/1 EUR or an equivalent in another currency that is instantaneously reverted). Such zero authorization is initiated on your provided payment method up to forty (40) days prior to the scheduled auto-renewal date. It helps ensure that your payment method is still valid and, respectively, leads to a seamless continuation of your Subscription. Zero authorization does not represent an actual charge to your account and will not be initiated if you choose to cancel your Subscription before the date of the zero authorization.

**Reminder:** We will send you a notification reminding you about the upcoming renewal of the Subscription and the then-current renewal price of our Services thirty (30) days before charging you for the upcoming period (except for users of monthly and shorter Subscriptions). If you do not wish to continue using our Services, you have the right to cancel the Subscription before the day of the charge.

**Billing:** We will charge you for the upcoming Subscription period in advance, i.e., before the beginning of such an upcoming Subscription period (unless you cancel the Subscription before the day of the charge). The charge in accordance with your chosen payment method will be made:

- **For monthly plans:** on the day of the scheduled auto-renewal (i.e., the start of the upcoming Subscription period).
- **For other plans:** at least fourteen (14) days before the scheduled auto-renewal (i.e., the start of the upcoming Subscription period).

Sometimes, Cicada is unable to charge the user by the auto-renewal date because the transaction fails on the user's side (e.g., expired card, insufficient funds balance). Please note that Cicada reserves the right to initiate automatic payment retries for any failed transactions within fourteen (14) days after the scheduled auto-renewal date. By using the Services, you acknowledge and accept Cicada's authority to perform such payment retries in an effort to process the necessary charges and ensure the provision of Services.

**Receipts and Invoices:** We will send you a receipt along with the purchase confirmation after you pay for the first Subscription period via email. Afterwards, you can view your billing history and manually generate the receipts and invoices for our Services at any time in your Account (log in to your Account, click the “Billing” button, and under Section “Billing history” generate the receipt/invoice by clicking “Get invoice”). Should you need to store the mentioned documents on your side, please download them to your device.

## 3. Cancellation and Refund

**Subscription Cancellation:** You can cancel your Subscription (i.e., turn off auto-renewals for the upcoming Service period) at any time from your Cicada Account if you purchased the Services directly from us: log in to your Account, open the “Billing” section, choose “Cancel Auto-renewal,” and confirm the cancellation by clicking “Cancel Auto-renewal.” Canceled Subscriptions will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing Service period. If you purchased the Services from a third party, your possibilities to cancel the Subscription are subject to its terms.

**Refund:** We seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, if you are not satisfied with our Services, you may cancel the Subscription and request a refund within thirty (30) days following your purchase of our Services. If you purchased the Services from a third party, granting of refunds is subject to its terms.

For more information about the cancellation and refund policy, please read Section 6 of our [General Terms](general_terms).
