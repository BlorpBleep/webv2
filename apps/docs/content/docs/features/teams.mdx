# CicadaVPN Teams – Helping team administrators manage their teams

### 1. What is CicadaVPN Teams?

CicadaVPN Teams is designed for small teams or organizations that want to provide VPN access to multiple members with centralized subscription management. A designated admin can manage all subscriptions, add or remove team members, and handle billing from a single portal.

### 2. How does the subscription pricing work?

The cost of the VPN is the same as our regular plans. However, the admin has the ability to manage team members centrally, allowing for streamlined subscription handling.

### 3. How do I add team members?

The admin can add new members by entering their email address in the Teams portal. The new member will receive an invitation to join the team, and once accepted, they can enjoy the benefits provided by the admin, such as extended subscription time.

### 4. What happens when a member leaves the team?

If a member is removed from the team, they will retain any benefits they have accrued, such as remaining subscription time. However, the admin will no longer be able to allocate new benefits to them.

### 5. Can the admin manage billing and invoices?

Yes, the admin has access to a portal where they can easily manage billing, view invoices, and monitor the status of all team members from a single location.

### 6. Can the admin extend subscription time for the entire team?

Yes, the admin can allocate subscription time to team members as needed. This allows the admin to manage how long each member remains on the VPN service.

### 7. What happens if a team member doesn’t accept the invitation?

If a team member doesn't accept the invitation, they won’t be added to the team or receive any benefits. The admin can resend the invitation if necessary.

### 8. Is there a limit to how many team members I can have?

The number of team members an admin can add may depend on the specific plan chosen, so please check your account details or contact customer support for more information.

### 9. How secure is the Teams portal?

The Teams portal is designed with security in mind, utilizing the latest encryption technologies to ensure that all billing, subscription, and team management information remains safe and confidential.
