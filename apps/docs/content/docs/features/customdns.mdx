# CicadaVPN Custom DNS: Ultimate Control Over Your Internet Traffic

CicadaVPN’s Custom DNS feature allows users to configure their own DNS servers, giving them full control over how their internet traffic is routed and managed. This feature is ideal for users who want to tailor their DNS settings to enhance privacy, security, or speed, while still enjoying the benefits of a secure VPN connection.

## What Is Custom DNS?

Custom DNS enables users to specify their own DNS servers instead of using the default ones provided by CicadaVPN. By setting a custom DNS, users can choose how DNS queries are resolved, enabling greater control over privacy, security, content filtering, and network performance.

### How Does Custom DNS Work?

By configuring a Custom DNS server, you direct all DNS queries through the server of your choice rather than the default DNS service. This allows for personalized network behavior, whether it’s to block ads, enhance speed, or add layers of security. Users can easily enter their preferred DNS server addresses directly in the CicadaVPN client.

#### Key Benefits of Custom DNS:

- **Enhanced Privacy:** Select DNS servers that are focused on privacy, ensuring that your DNS queries are not logged or tracked.
