PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ALL OF THEM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OR ANY PROVISIONS HEREOF, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES AND/OR WEBSITES.**\n\n### 2.2 Service Specific Terms\nCertain Services (such as CicadaVPN) may require additional terms and conditions. Your use of our Services specified below is subject to the General Terms and Service Specific Terms (\"Service Specific Terms\"):\n\n- CicadaVPN Additional Terms\n\nBy using the Services, you also agree to the Service Specific Terms applicable to the respective Service(s). If there is any conflict or inconsistency between clauses in the Terms and Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms govern and apply in relation to that specific Service(s).\n\n### 2.3 Services\nOur Services are usually provided as paid Services. We also may offer a version of certain Services which is provided free of charge. The Terms apply to both types of Services.\n\n### 2.4 Accessing the Services and/or Websites\nYou affirm that you are eighteen (18) or more years of age or have the authority to act on behalf of a valid legal entity, and you are fully able and have all rights and power to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, and to abide by and comply with them.\n\n### 2.5 Updates to the Terms\nWe develop our Services and Websites by introducing new features or modifying current ones constantly. Additionally, we may need to update the Terms by amending them from time to time (i) to comply with the law; (ii) to comply with orders/recommendations of regulatory authorities; (iii) to add additional functionality, services, features, technologies, and/or benefits, or to remove the old ones; (iv) to correct errors and bugs; (v) to clarify the Terms; (vi) to prevent abuse or harm; (vii) for any other valid reason (e.g., for security reasons). \n\nYou understand and agree that it is your obligation to review the Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations.

Unless stated otherwise, each update of the Terms comes into force as of the moment when amended Terms are published. Your continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance thereof. You can also end your relationship with us at any time after the effective date of the updated Terms by closing your Account and/or not accessing our Services and Websites.\n\n**THE TERMS MAY CHANGE, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO REVIEW THE TERMS PERIODICALLY.**\n\n## 3. SUBSCRIPTION AND AUTO-RENEWALS\n\n### 3.1 Subscription\nAll our paid Services are provided on a Subscription basis. You choose the period of Services and the payment method yourself when you purchase the Services. Please review the [Subscription Terms](subscription_terms) for more information.\n\n### 3.2 Auto-Renewal\nAfter the end of your Service period, your Subscription will automatically renew for the successive defined Service periods at the renewal dates, unless you decide to cancel the Subscription renewal before the day of the charge. If you do not cancel the Subscription in such due course, your chosen payment method will be charged the then-current renewal price for the upcoming defined Service period.\n\n## 4. YOUR USER ACCOUNT\n\n### 4.1 Creating an Account\nTo access and use any of our Services, you must set up an Account by providing certain information (e.g., your email address, password, billing information, country). All information you provide must be complete, accurate, true to the fact, and kept up to date. All CicadaVPN Accounts are non-transferable.\n\n### 4.2 Confidentiality of and Access to the Account\nYou agree to accept responsibility and are solely responsible for any and all usage and activities that occur under your Account or password, including, but not limited to, use of the Account by any other person, whether or not authorized by you. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and its password, and for restricting access to your Account by any other party. To protect your Account, keep your password confidential. Do not reuse your Account password with other services. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account or password.\n\n## 5. PRICES AND PAYMENTS\n\n### 5.1 Total Price\nPrices of our Services initially displayed to you may be provided exclusive of taxes. Due to the worldwide nature of our Services and the mobility of consumers, we might not be able to identify the particular taxes applicable to you in advance. Therefore, we can calculate the additional mandatory taxes (e.g., sales tax, value-added tax, or another mandatory tax under laws applicable to you) only after you choose your tax residence country. In any case, we will display the sum of additional taxes applicable to your purchase along with the total price of your payment before charging you.\n\n### 5.2 Payments\nYou agree to pay us for any paid Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your Account, including applicable taxes and fees associated with your purchase of the Services. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive a full payment from you on time. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your Account and its content.\n\n### 5.3 Recurring Payments\nWhen you purchase the Services on a Subscription basis (e.g., monthly, annually, or otherwise), you agree that (i) Services will auto-renew until you cancel them, (ii) you are authorizing recurring payments, (iii) payments will be made to CicadaVPN by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, and (iv) when applicable, CicadaVPN may receive and use updated card account information from the financial institution that has issued your card (used to purchase the Services). For more information about the Subscription and its cancellation, please read our [Subscription Terms](subscription_terms).\n\n### 5.4 Payment Methods\nTo purchase Services directly through us on our Websites, you must provide us with a current and valid method of payment, such as a credit or debit card or any other payment method available on the Websites.\n\n### 5.5 Billing\nBy providing CicadaVPN with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize CicadaVPN to charge the payment method you provided; and (iii) authorize CicadaVPN to charge you for any paid Services you chose when making a purchase. You can view your billing history and manually generate the receipts and invoices for our Services at any time in your Account (log in to your Account, click the \"Billing\" button, and under Section \"Billing history\" generate the receipt/invoice by clicking \"Get invoice\"). If you have any questions related to payments, please contact us.\n\n### 5.6 Payment Providers\nPurchases may be handled via multiple payment companies. To find out more on how payment companies process your personal data, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](privacy).\n\n### 5.7 Payment Processing\nCicadaVPN also reserves the right to (i) obtain and continue using updated credit card account information\n\n electronically, when applicable, from the card brands, (ii) retry failed payments to complete transactions, including but not limited to, retrying failed cards with extended expiration dates, and (iii) change or amend authorized payment companies to assist with payment processing.\n\n### 5.8 Fraud Protection\nCicadaVPN reserves the right to verify credit/debit card payments prior to completing your purchase.\n\n### 5.9 Change of Prices\nWe may at our reasonable discretion change the price of our paid Services, including Subscription renewal prices, from time to time to reflect the changes of the total costs associated with our Services. Examples of cost elements that affect the price of our Services include licensing costs, costs for the technical provision and distribution, and other costs of sales (e.g., billing, marketing), general administration, and other overhead costs (e.g., rent, interest and other financing costs, costs of personnel, service providers and services, IT systems, energy), as well as state-imposed fees, contributions, taxes, and duties. Any changes to the pricing will not affect your current Subscription period and will become effective only upon the Subscription renewal. We will always send you a notification prior to charging with an upcoming payment amount. Subject to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change of renewal price, your sole remedy is to cancel your Subscription before the next charge is made, and (ii) your continued use of the Services without canceling the Subscription constitutes your agreement to pay the new renewal price for the Services.\n\n### 5.10 Changes of Payment Details\nIf any of your payment details change (like card number or its expiry date), please let us know as soon as possible so we can continue to provide the Services when it comes time for the Subscription renewal. If you update payment details in your Account, the updated information will be regarded as your preferred method for any future payments. Sometimes we may receive updated credit or debit card information from your card issuer or the card network, which CicadaVPN will use to update your payment details automatically.\n\n### 5.11 Free Trials\nIn some cases, we or others on our behalf may offer a free trial for our paid Services prior to charging your payment method (\"Free Trial\"). The duration of the Free Trial, its use, and other details will be specified during a sign-up and/or in the promotional materials. We determine your Free Trial eligibility at our sole discretion, and to the extent permitted under applicable law we may limit or withdraw the Free Trial option at any time without notice. If you provide your payment details when signing up for the Subscription with a Free Trial, we will automatically charge you for the Subscription of our paid Services, and it will auto-renew until canceled. If you do not want to continue with a paid Subscription after the Free Trial, you must cancel it before the end of the Free Trial. If you received the Free Trial from a third party, you may cancel the paid Subscription through that third party. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a paid Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.\n\n## 6. CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY\n\n### 6.1 Subscription Cancellation\nYou have a right to cancel your Subscription (i.e., turn off auto-renewals for the upcoming Service period) at any time (please note that canceled Subscriptions will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing Service period). Your possibilities to cancel the Subscription and/or get a refund may differ depending on whether you purchased Services from (or are billed through) CicadaVPN or a third party (e.g., app store, service provider, retailer).\n\n### 6.2 Refund\nWe seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, if you are not satisfied with our Services, you may cancel the Subscription and request a refund within thirty (30) days following your purchase of our Services (\"Money Back Guarantee\"). Please note that Subscriptions may be refunded on the basis of the Money Back Guarantee only after the initial purchase. Once a Subscription is renewed, it cannot be refunded on the basis of the Money Back Guarantee, unless applicable law provides otherwise (please refer to the Section 6.3 \"Pro Rata Refund\" below). To the extent permitted under applicable law, we reserve the right not to issue the mentioned refund in the event of a breach of Section 8 of the General Terms (\"Prohibited and Restricted Use\"). In any case, we would be glad to troubleshoot an issue you experienced before you decide to request the Money Back Guarantee.\n\n### 6.3 Pro Rata Refund\nA Subscription longer than one month which has been renewed and purchased from Germany (after March 1, 2022), Netherlands, or the United Kingdom, is eligible for either: (i) a full refund, if a refund request is made within thirty (30) days of being charged for automatic renewal; or (ii) if the mentioned thirty (30) days term has passed - a pro rata (partial) refund for the period left in your renewed Subscription, beginning the month after you request the refund.\n\n### 6.4 Payment of Refund\nYour request will be processed without any unreasonable delay and the refund will be paid using the same payment method as the one used for the purchase, except as otherwise mutually agreed, unless applicable law prohibits us or payment service providers we rely on from processing the refund. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the refund will be made in the same cryptocurrency or in another cryptocurrency if the one used for the purchase becomes unavailable or impracticable to use. The amount to be refunded in cryptocurrency will be calculated based on the equivalent of the price paid in USD at the time of purchase. Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards will not be refunded if such a refund is not supported by the provider of the card. Once the refund is issued to you, you will lose access to the Services for which you were refunded.\n\n### 6.5 Eligibility for Refund\nYou are eligible to get a refund for our Services under the Money Back Guarantee according to Section 6.2. If you buy a particular Service again after the refund for such Service, you will not be granted the Money Back Guarantee for any of its further cancellations. In case you cancel your Subscription at any time after the expiration of the respective Money Back Guarantee period, you shall be charged for the whole Subscription's duration (e.g., if you purchase an annual Subscription and you decide to cancel your Subscription after two (2) months, you will be charged the whole price, but once the Subscription has ended, it will not be renewed). Please be advised that our refund process is automated to ensure efficiency and timely response to user requests. If, however, you believe that the decision made by our automated refunds system is incorrect, and in accordance with applicable law, you have the right to get a refund, please reach out to us at support@cicadavpn.com and our customer support will review your case.\n\n### 6.6 Subscriptions Purchased via Apple App Store\nSubscriptions purchased via the Apple App Store are subject to Apple App Store refund policies. This means we cannot grant a refund if you made a purchase through the Apple App Store - please read Apple's in-app purchase refund policy and/or contact store support. If you purchased an automatically renewing Subscription through the Apple App Store and would like to cancel it, you will need to do so in your Apple App Store account directly. Instructions can be found here: [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039#third_party](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039#third_party).\n\n### 6.7 Subscriptions Purchased via other Providers\nThe refunds for purchases made from third-party app stores, marketplaces, retailers, and resellers (e.g., Amazon Marketplace, Amazon Appstore, Google Play, BestBuy, StackSocial) are handled according to the terms of service of the providers from which the Services were purchased. Cancellation of such Subscriptions may also be subject to the terms of certain providers.\n\n### 6.8 Canceling the Auto-Renewal of the Subscription Purchased on our Websites\nIf you have purchased an automatically renewing Subscription on our Websites and would like to stop it from automatically renewing, you can do so at any time from your CicadaVPN Account. Canceled Subscriptions will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing Service period.\n\n## 7.

However, if your Account has been suspended, you must contact us for further information. We may (but have no obligation to) suspend your Account for a reasonable period before we terminate it permanently.\n\nUsually, we will send you prior notice before suspending or terminating your Account and/or Services. However, under limited circumstances, we will be unable to send notice to you prior to terminating your access to our Services if: (i) you are in material breach of Section 8 of the General Terms (\"Prohibited and Restricted Use\") or any applicable laws in such a way as to immediately and seriously endanger us and/or any other third party or cause disruption to our Services; (ii) we are unable to send you notice because you have not provided or properly updated your contact details; (iii) we are unable to notify you due to the requirements of law and/or orders of the authorities.\n\nAny suspension or termination of your Account and/or Services by CicadaVPN applies to you personally; you may not access our Services through any other Account that you own or create or through Accounts owned or created by others.\n\n### 12.2 Termination by You\nYou may cancel the Services at any time as set forth in Section 6 of the General Terms (\"Cancellation and Refund Policy\"). On how to terminate (delete) your Account, please read our [Privacy Policy](privacy).\n\n### 12.3 Effects on Suspension or Termination\nUpon suspension or termination under these Terms, you will lose access to the Services and you shall cease all use of the Software. Upon expiration of your Subscription or any termination under these Terms, the License granted in Section 7.1 of these General Terms and any other licenses, if any, will immediately terminate without further notice from us. Therefore, you shall cease all use of the Software and Services, as well as delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Software in your possession or control.\n\n### 12.4 Survival of Termination\nSections 7-16 of the General Terms will survive termination or expiration of the Terms for any reason, as well as any other Sections of these Terms that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination or expiration of these Terms.\n\n## 13. APPLICATION PLATFORM TERMS\n\n### 13.1 App Store\nIf you downloaded our Software from Apple App Store or if you are using such Software and our Services on any Apple-branded device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple:\n\nThese Terms are concluded between you and CicadaVPN, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Services and the content thereof. If you need any support with respect to our Services, please contact us, not Apple as they are under no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance or support services with respect to our Services. To the extent that the Services fail to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Service to you; to the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation with respect to the Services. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the application infringe that third party's intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms, when using the Service. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \"terrorist supporting\" country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n\n### 13.2 Other Stores\nIf our Software is downloaded from any other store, platform, marketplace (e\n\n.g., Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Microsoft Store, HUAWEI AppGallery), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the customer terms of use of such stores, platforms, and marketplaces. CicadaVPN is the licensor of the Software and the provider of the Services and any third party (e.g., operator of the store, platform, marketplace) is not a party to these Terms.\n\n## 14. BUNDLED SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES\n\n### 14.1 Bundled Subscriptions\nYou may purchase a Subscription of CicadaVPN Service bundled with the Subscription of other CicadaVPN Service and/or subscription of Third Party Services (as described below) (\"Bundled Subscriptions\").\n\n### 14.2 Third Party Services Acquired through CicadaVPN\nWe may offer to acquire third-party products and/or services independently (as a standalone service) or along with our Services for a fee or free of charge (as a Bundled Subscription) through CicadaVPN (\"Third Party Services\"). In all cases, your billing relationship for such services will be directly with CicadaVPN and any fees charged for it will be billed by us using your provided payment method. Please note that Third Party Services are governed not only by these Terms but also by terms of use issued by such third parties respectively (which you also accept by acquiring Third Party Services through CicadaVPN). Please review the terms of use and other policies of Third Party Services carefully and make sure you understand them before you acquire them through CicadaVPN. After the acquisition of Third Party Services through CicadaVPN, you may need to follow additional instructions to use them (e.g., to create a separate account). If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of use of Third Party Services and these Terms concerning Subscription purchase, auto-renewals, prices/payments, and cancellation/refunds, these Terms govern and apply.\n\n### 14.3 Cancellation of Bundled Subscription/Third Party Services\nYou may cancel your Bundled Subscription/Third Party Services (i.e., turn off auto-renewals for the upcoming Service period) at any time. By canceling your Bundled Subscription, you will lose access to all Bundled Services (i.e., if you wish to cancel, the only option is to cancel all CicadaVPN Services and Third Party Services purchased as a Bundled Subscription; you cannot cancel only one or some of the Services leaving the others active for the upcoming period).\n\n### 14.4 CicadaVPN Services Purchased through Third Parties\nYou may purchase CicadaVPN Services along with third-party services as a bundled subscription offered by third parties. Please review the terms of use and other policies of third-party bundled subscriptions carefully and make sure you understand them before you purchase such bundled subscriptions through third parties.\n\n## 15. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n### 15.1 Governing Law\nThese Terms will be governed by the law of Panama except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including countries of the European Union) have laws that require contracts to be governed by the mandatory provisions of the local laws of the consumer's country. In such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.\n\n### 15.2 Out-of-Court Resolution of Disputes\nWe always strive to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against CicadaVPN, please try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written notice of the dispute at support@cicadavpn.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved, you or CicadaVPN may bring a formal proceeding.\n\n### 15.3 Judicial Resolution of Disputes\nYou and CicadaVPN agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to the Terms will be brought in the courts of Panama. If you reside in a country (including countries of the European Union) where laws provide consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, in such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.\n\n### 15.4 Online Dispute Resolution in the EU\nIf you are a consumer, you may report the dispute to a consumer dispute body in your country of residence, in accordance with local regulations and practices. If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).\n\n## 16. CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\n**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**\n\n**WHERE PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND CICADAVPN AGREE THAT EACH SHALL ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CICADAVPN AGREE, NO ARBITRATOR OR JUDGE SHALL CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.**\n\n## 17. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n### 17.1 Availability of Services\nActual coverage, speeds, locations, and quality of Services may vary. CicadaVPN attempts to improve and provide Services at all times. However, our Services may not be available without prior notice or CicadaVPN's liability, including when (i) we test, update, expand, add, or remove our Services, features, functionalities, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements (ii) we experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance, or human errors; (iii) events beyond our control (e.g., events in nature and other force majeure events) happen.\n\n### 17.2 Modification and Termination of Services\nWe reserve the right to modify or update the operation of the Services at our sole discretion, at any time, for any reason, and without notice or liability. We may also suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so. If you have prepaid fees directly to CicadaVPN for a paid Subscription that CicadaVPN permanently discontinues prior to the end of its period, CicadaVPN will refund you the pro-rata part of such prepaid fees for the period after such discontinuation (except for cases referred to in Section 12.1 of these General Terms), and in such case, your Account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you. CicadaVPN has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of the authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.\n\n### 17.3 Severability\nIf any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by any competent authority, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that other provisions of the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\n\n### 17.4 Assignment\nYou may not assign these Terms or any rights or interest under these Terms or delegate any obligations to be performed under these Terms, without CicadaVPN's prior written consent. CicadaVPN can assign, transfer, delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms to selected third parties without your consent, including but not limited to, in cases of corporate reorganization, merger, acquisitions, sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of company assets. Notification of any material changes that affect your rights or obligations will be provided to you by reasonable means (e.g., via email).\n\n### 17.5 Data Charges\nYou are responsible for any charges that may apply to your use of our Services or Websites, including text messaging and data charges if you access or use the Services or Websites on your mobile or other devices. If you're unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your mobile operator, internet, or other service providers before using the Services/Websites.\n\n### 17.6 Third-Party Components\nYou acknowledge that our Services, Software, and Websites, may incorporate, embed, be combined with, or may otherwise interact with third-party computer programs, applications, services, links, and components (\"Third-Party Components\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Section 9 (\"Disclaimer of Warranties\") and Section 10 (\"Limitation of Liabilities\") of these General Terms apply to the foregoing interaction with Third-Party Components. Where our Websites contain links to other websites and/or resources provided by third parties, which include third-party social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, they are provided for your information only. Please review the third-party website's terms of use and other policies carefully and make sure you understand them before you engage in any transaction.\n\n### 17.7 Linking to our Websites\nYou may link to our Websites, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part where none exists.\n\n### 17.8 Communication with CicadaVPN\nYou may provide notices, requests, information, and other communications to CicadaVPN via our customer support. You agree to receive communications from us electronically, e.g., by email, through our applications, and customer support platforms, and consent that such notifications have the same legal power as communication in writing. We may communicate with you to advise you about the provision,\n\n changes, or additions to the Services or for other purposes that are reasonable or required by applicable law. When communicating with our customer support representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. In addition, you undertake to provide accurate data for communication with us and, if your contact details have changed, update them in your Account immediately. CicadaVPN is not liable if you do not receive certain notices regarding the Services upon your failure to update your contact details.\n\n### 17.9 Internet Connection\nCertain Services may require an active and stable connection to the internet in order to function. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that you have at all times an active and stable internet connection.\n\n### 17.10 Export Laws\nCicadaVPN products may be subject to the United States (U.S.) and European Union export and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\") maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce. You warrant that you are (i) not located in any country to which the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom or other relevant jurisdiction has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions, which would forbid or limit the use, import, export, sale of, or payment for the Services; and (ii) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in relevant jurisdictions or otherwise listed on any list of prohibited or restricted parties as administered by the Office of Foreign Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\"OFAC\"), the U.S. Department of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty's Treasury of the United Kingdom, or other relevant sanctions authority (\"Sanctions Authorities\"). You agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations, including without limitation the EAR and trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC as it may be applicable to you. Specifically, you agree not to - directly or indirectly - use, sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, release, or otherwise dispose of any CicadaVPN Services, including products, software, or technology (notwithstanding products derived from or based on such technology) received from under these Terms to any destination, entity, or person or for any end-use prohibited by the applicable export control laws, trade and economic sanctions maintained by Sanctions Authorities or any applicable laws or regulations without obtaining any required prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.\n\n### 17.11 Exclusions\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some limitations above may not apply to you.\n\n### 17.12 Prevailing Language\nFor all purposes, the English language version of the Terms shall be the original, governing instrument and understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between this English language version of the Terms and any subsequent translation into any other language, the English language version shall govern and control.\n\n### 17.13 Force Majeure\nCicadaVPN shall not be in breach of the Terms nor liable for delay in performing, or failing to perform, any obligations under the Terms if such delay or failure result from unforeseen circumstances, events, or causes beyond CicadaVPN's reasonable control (including, without limitation, failures of third-party software (whether open or not), failures of your telecommunication or internet service providers, force majeure, earthquakes, fires, floods, embargoes, labor disputes and strikes, riots, war, novelty of product manufacture or other unanticipated product development problems, and acts of civil and military authorities). In such cases, CicadaVPN shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of the time for performing any such obligations under the Terms.\n\n### 17.14 No Reliance\nThe parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on any representation made but not expressly contained in these Terms.\n\n## 18.
